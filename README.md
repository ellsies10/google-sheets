# google-sheets

I like to make automated Google Sheets. To recreate, follow these steps:
1. Click the link to the Google Sheet.
2. Click "Make a copy"
3. Click "Extensions" and "Apps Script"
4. Copy source code into the code window.
5. (Not always necessary:) Add triggers as specified by the README.
